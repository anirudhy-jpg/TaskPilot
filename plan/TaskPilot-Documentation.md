# TaskPilot — Project Documentation

> **Last Updated:** June 24, 2026 — Reflects full production state of the application.

## Project Overview

TaskPilot is a modern project management and workflow tracking application built to help teams organize work, manage projects, and track task progress in a unified platform. The platform is designed to support modern workflows with an intuitive interface, structured data model, and a fully realized realtime collaboration system.

The purpose of TaskPilot is to provide an adaptable workspace for managing tasks, projects, and workflows across teams. It serves as a centralized system for planning work, monitoring progress, and enables advanced collaboration through invitations, role-based access, real-time updates, and workspace-level analytics.

## Project Goals

- **Task Management** ✅: Create, update, organize, and track tasks across projects with priority, due dates, descriptions, assignees, subtasks, and rich interaction elements.
- **Task Collaboration** ✅: Task-level comments, interactive activity timelines, and progress tracking via subtasks.
- **Project Management** ✅: Project creation, editing, deletion, and lifecycle tracking with kanban boards and custom columns.
- **Workflow Tracking** ✅: Board-based workflow view with drag-and-drop task management and custom column workflows.
- **Task Attachments** ✅: Securely upload, preview, and manage files associated with tasks using Supabase Storage and signed URLs.
- **Time Tracking** ✅: Built-in active timers and manual time logs to track time spent on individual tasks, including visual statistics.
- **Team Collaboration** ✅: Shared workspaces, member roles, email invitations, task assignments, and activity notifications.
- **Realtime Sync** ✅: Instant board updates across all connected clients via Supabase Realtime WebSocket channels.
- **Workspace Analytics** ✅: Live workspace overview dashboard with task distribution charts, member activity stats, and notification feed.

## Conclusion

TaskPilot has evolved from a planned two-week MVP into a fully-featured, production-ready collaborative project management platform. All core phases (authentication, workspace management, project/task CRUD, kanban board, team collaboration, realtime sync, analytics, UI polish, and input validation with tests) are now **complete and functional**.

The architecture maintains a clean separation between the Next.js App Router (routing only), feature modules (business logic), server actions (mutations), and Supabase services (data layer). The codebase is fully type-safe, Zod-validated at all boundaries, follows feature-based colocation conventions, and is ready for the next phase of search enhancements.
